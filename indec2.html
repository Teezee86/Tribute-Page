        <h3>Who wass Socrates?</h3>

        <p>
          was a classical Greek philosopher and accredited as one of the founders of Western
          philosophy. He wrote nothing himself; our understanding of him comes from his students,
          primarily Plato and Xenophon.
          Socrates spent his life engaging in philosophical discussions and is famous for
          the Socratic method, which involves asking probing questions to stimulate critical thinking.
          He was Accused of impiety and corrupting the youth and was sentenced to death by the
          Athenian court.
          His death sentence was to consume poison hemlock,
          and as a final lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and
          faces it calmly

      <h2>The Death Of Socrates</h2>
      <section id="death-story">
        <h3>The Story</h3>
        In Plato’s <a
          href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Asection%3D29a">
          Apology(29a-b)</a>, Socrates agues that he does not fear death; indeed, to fear death is a sign of ignorance.
        It is to claim to know what one in fact does not know (Ap. 29 a-b). Perhaps, Socrates suggests, death is not a
        great evil after all, but <q>"the greatest of all goods.”</q> At the end of the dialogue, after the judges have
        voted on the final verdict and Socrates has received the death penalty, the philosopher considers two common
        views of death: that death is a long dreamless sleep and that death is a journey to another place - Hades.
        According to Socrates, either of these views of death would be acceptable to him; the one, because he would
        receive a
        wonderful rest with no dreams to disturb him; the other, because he would be able to talk philosophy with those
        who had gone before with impunity.

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Socrates">
            <i>The Death of Socrates (French: La Mort de Socrate)</i></a>is an oil on canvas painted by French painter
          Jacques-Louis David in 1787. The painting was part of the neoclassical style, popular in the 1780s, that
          depicted subjects from the Classical age, in this case the story ofthe execution of Socrates as told by Plato
          in his Phaedo. In this story, Socrates has been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing
          strange gods, and has been sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock. Socrates uses his death as a final
          lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly. The Phaedo depicts
          the death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final days,
          which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.

      <h2>Authors Thoughts</h2>
      <p> When I first started this project for <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp's</a>
        Responsive Web Design course, I originally wanted to use <a href="#">Fredrich Neitszche</a>,
        not that there is anything wrong with Neitszche. I just felt there were already a ton of
        pages dedicated to him and I wanted to learn about someone new. I had heard Socrates was one
        of the originals so i figured id dive into who he was and what his gig was.
        I found Socrates to be a a nice release from the philosophy i have tried to dive into
        before.
        He questioned everything, which is something I believe is Important. His morals intrigued me
        and felt familiar It is said the he had said "" I believe asking questions is where we gain
        not only knowledge but also Character. I found Socrates to be an interesting subject to
        learn about. I was also completely unaware that he had never wrote anything down. Mostly
        what has been written was from his students like Plato.
        Anyway This was a fun project. I tried to design the page as minimal as possible with key
        points and Visual stimulation at the fore front for an all around pleasant experience
