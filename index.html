                    <p class="p-text"><strong>Socrates (469-399 BC)</strong> was a classical Greek philosopher and one
                        of the founders of
                        Western philosophy. He
                        wrote nothing himself; our understanding of him comes from his students, primarily Plato and
                        Xenophon.
