                    <p><span>When I first started this project for <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp's</a>
                            Responsive Web Design course, I originally wanted to use <a href="#">Fredrich Neitszche</a>,
                            not that there is anything wrong with Neitszche. I just felt there were already a ton of
                            pages dedicated to him and I wanted to learn about someone new. I had heard Socrates was one
                            of the originals so i figured id dive into who he was and what his gig was.
                            I found Socrates to be a a nice release from the philosophy i have tried to dive into
                            before.
                            He questioned everything, which is something I believe is Important. His morals intrigued me
                            and felt familiar It is said the he had said "" I believe asking questions is where we gain
                            not only knowledge but also Character. I found Socrates to be an interesting subject to
                            learn about. I was also completely unaware that he had never wrote anything down. Mostly
                            what has been written was from his students like Plato.
                            Anyway This was a fun project. I tried to design the page as minimal as possible with key
                            points and Visual stimulation at the fore front for an all around pleasant experience</p>

                        was a classical Greek philosopher and accredited as one of the founders of Western
                        philosophy. He wrote nothing himself; our understanding of him comes from his students,
                        primarily Plato and Xenophon.
                        Socrates spent his life engaging in philosophical discussions and is famous for
                        the Socratic method, which involves asking probing questions to stimulate critical thinking.
                        He was Accused of impiety and corrupting the youth and was sentenced to death by the
                        Athenian court.
                        His death sentence was to consume poison hemlock,
                        and as a final lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and
                        faces it calmly.</p>

                <h2>The Death Of Socrates</h2>
                <p><span>In Plato’s <a
                            href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Asection%3D29a">Apology
                            (29a-b)</a>,
                        Socrates agues that he does not fear death; indeed, to fear death is a sign of ignorance. It is
                        to claim to know what one in fact does not know (Ap. 29 a-b). Perhaps,
                        Socrates suggests, death is not a great evil after all, but “the greatest of all goods.” At the
                        end of the dialogue, after the judges have voted on the final verdict and Socrates has received
                        the death penalty, the philosopher considers two common views of death: that death is a long
                        dreamless sleep and that death is a journey to another place - Hades. According to Socrates,
                        either of these views of death would be acceptable to him; the one, because he would receive a
                        wonderful rest with no dreams to disturb him; the other, because he would be able to talk
                        philosophy with those who had gone before with impunity.</span>

                            <i>The Death of Socrates (French: La Mort de Socrate)</i></a>is an oil on canvas painted by
                        French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787. The painting was part of the neoclassical style,
                        popular in the 1780s, that depicted subjects from the Classical age, in this case the story of
                        the execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his Phaedo. In this story, Socrates has been
                        convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods, and has been sentenced
                        to die by drinking poison hemlock. Socrates uses his death as a final lesson for his pupils
                        rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly. The Phaedo depicts the
                        death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final
                        days, which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.
